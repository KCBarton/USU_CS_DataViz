    <div> I got my bachelor's degree in mathematics from Westminster College where I played DII basketball.
        My formal background here at USU is in applied mathematics. I especially love to solve differential equations
    and hope to have a mathematical modeling job after graduation. As far as coding goes, I started on Java
    and have since forgotten all of it. My main programming language is Python and I know a little bit of R.
    I have never done HTML so it's exciting to be able to learn it! This last summer I had an internship
    with the Air Force analyzing text data and coming up with equations to optimize job performance.
