<div>My name is KC Gubler and I am from a small town in Southern Utah.
    I come from a family of 6 and recently got hitched this last summer.
    My husband has a business working construction while I am here at Utah State getting my MS in Industrial Mathematics.
    Below is a picture of our wedding with our family.</div>
